#### Scrolling stories with CartoDB templates and multiple maps

A summary of work I did at the NYPL historical map data hackathon. I just used a scrolling story layout to talk about the maps I created over an afternoon.

#### Sun position plus street orientation

Demo I put together of the VECNIK vector rendering with current sunposition to find streets getting a lot of sun exposure

 - [demo](http://andrewxhill.github.io/cartodb-examples/manhattanhenge/today.html)

or taking a look at places where Manhattanhenge happens for any day of the year,

see a couple of other cities,

#### Two maps, one center

This is a really quick mod of the CartoDB double map template. In the [orignal template](http://cartodb.github.io/cartodb-publishing-templates/doublemap/), both maps have the same center, and moving one map moves the other. A question on our forum from [Michael Keller](https://twitter.com/mhkeller) prompted me to make this version, where there is only a single center, so one map bleeds into the other. Hacky hacky

#### Writable Polygon

This example uses PostgreSQL to turn CartoDB into a form submit endpoint without any proxy layer.

#### Changing polygon intensity over time [D3]

This example uses the CartoDB SQL API and D3 to show a changing intensity in state polygons over time.

 - [code](http://github.com/andrewxhill/cartodb-examples/blob/master/intensity-time)
 - [demo](http://andrewxhill.github.io/cartodb-examples/intensity-time/index.html)

#### Experiments with Videos, CartoDB, and Leaflet

This example makes a video's playing timestamp into a control for a map

 - [demo](http://andrewxhill.github.io/cartodb-examples/videomap/html5/index.html)

Quick test to create a Leaflet plugin for a VideoOVerlay object

with canvas,

or with Vimeo,
